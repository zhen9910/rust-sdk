# WASM Component Implementation Summary

## What We Built

1. **WASM Component**: `mcp_client_stdio_wasm` - A WebAssembly component that acts as an MCP client
2. **WASI Stdio Transport**: Uses WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) for stdio communication
3. **Integration Demo**: Updated the stdio transport example to demonstrate WASM component usage

## Key Features

### WASM Component (`mcp_client_stdio_wasm`)
- ✅ Built as a `cdylib` (C dynamic library) for WASM compatibility
- ✅ Uses WASI for stdin/stdout communication (following existing WASI example pattern)
- ✅ Implements async I/O using the same pattern as the server-side WASI example
- ✅ Can call `list_tools()` to get available tools from MCP server
- ✅ Can execute tool calls (sum, sub) via MCP protocol
- ✅ Compiles to `target/wasm32-wasip2/debug/mcp_client_stdio_wasm.wasm`

### Stdio Transport Integration
- ✅ Added `wasm` mode to stdio example: `cargo run --example stdio wasm`
- ✅ Spawns MCP server subprocess
- ✅ Loads WASM component and demonstrates integration concept
- ✅ Shows how WASM component would communicate with MCP server via WASI stdio

## How It Works

1. **Host Application** (`stdio.rs` with `wasm` argument):
   - Spawns MCP server as subprocess
   - Loads WASM component from disk
   - Sets up stdio pipes between host and server
   - (Currently demonstrates concept - full Wasmtime API integration is next step)

2. **WASM Component** (`mcp_client_stdio_wasm.wasm`):
   - Runs in WASI environment
   - Uses WASI stdin/stdout for MCP communication
   - Sends JSON-RPC messages to communicate with MCP server
   - Calls `list_tools()` and tool execution methods

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `examples/mcp_client_stdio_wasm/Cargo.toml` - WASM component configuration
- `examples/mcp_client_stdio_wasm/src/lib.rs` - WASM component implementation
- `examples/mcp_client_stdio_wasm/README.md` - Documentation

### Modified Files:
- `examples/transport/src/stdio.rs` - Added WASM demo mode
- `examples/transport/Cargo.toml` - Added process feature for tokio

## Testing

```bash
# Build WASM component
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2 -p mcp_client_stdio_wasm

# Test regular stdio demo
cargo run --example stdio

# Test WASM integration demo
cargo run --example stdio wasm

# Test WASM component directly
echo '{}' | wasmtime run target/wasm32-wasip2/debug/mcp_client_stdio_wasm.wasm
```

## Next Steps for Full Integration

To complete full WASM integration with Wasmtime API:
1. Use `wasmtime::component::Component` to load the WASM component
2. Set up WASI stdio redirection to connect to MCP server pipes
3. Execute the WASM component within the host process
4. Handle the component's stdio I/O through the Wasmtime runtime

This foundation provides a working WASM component that can be extended for full integration.
